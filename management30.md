# Management 3.0
- Source: "Management 3.0" by Jurgen Appelo. Although many thoughts from the book are mentioned here, these notes are no replacement for the book. Go ahead and read it!
- one of the most-cited books about management (cited as a good book! ;) )
- oscillating chapters: theory, practical approach

## Preface
### Management 1.0
- Hierarchies
- Command and Control
- top-down management
- source of bonus and incentive systems

---

### Management 2.0
- "addons" for Management 1.0
- Balanced Scorecard, Six Sigma, Theory of Constraints, Total Quality Management
- top-down management
- rapidly changing and new addons

### Management 3.0
- 21th century = "century of complexity" (Stephan Hawking)
- Management 3.0 = complexity
- organizations = networks
- management = about people and their relationships, not departments and profits
- organizations = living systems

---

## Chapter 1 - Why things are not simple
- agile software development = best way to develop software, but old-style management = biggest obstacle
- agile managers have to learn how social systems work because they manage people
- humans prefer causality: "If this, then that" because brains made for it
- causality works great for small problems
- but: causality not enough for complex world
- complexity != large numbers. Small problems can be complex, too: water = system out of things out of only three atoms, however very complex
- needed: strategies to deal with complex problems

---

### Reductionism
- = deconstruct systems to understand its parts
- then deconstruct these parts
- Problem: doesn't work entirely, for example predicting weather or economy
- root-cause-analysis (like "5 Whys") don't work necessarily because they discover only one root
 
---
 
### Holism
- = behavior of system is more than just behavior of parts
- problems can be found by deconstructing a system, but they cannot be prevented by only looking at isolated parts

---

### Hierarchical Management
- management happens in levels
- each level has its own rules and qualifications
- mastering one level != being successful in another level
- no need to be an expert about all lower levels, but knowing the fundamentals helps a lot!

---

### Agile Management
- = hierarchical management that embraces complexity and nonlinear thinking
- making errors and learn from it

---

## Chapter 2 - Agile Software Development
### The way to agile
- "agile" = new word for old virtues
- result of development that took decades
- early days of creating software: no best practices, many different approaches
- formal approaches: software development = engineering with models, methods, frameworks, ... => much bureaucracy and paperwork that slowed development down
- early 1990s: Rapid Application Development (RAD) = some formal methods + prototyping, evolutionary delivery, customer collaboration => Scrum (1995), Feature Driven Development (1999), Pragmatic Programming (1999)
- 2001: Agile manifesto

---

### Other systems
- Lean Software development, derived from 14 principles of Toyota way + 14 points for Management by W. Edwards Deming = focus on removing waste and optimizing the whole
- Software Craftsmanship = see Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship, software developers != engineers but craftsman
- Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) = huge framework that can be applied to other systems, not just software
- others: Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), PRINCE2, Unified Process, Rational Unified Process (RUP)

### Main question: What is the role of management in an agile world?

---

- TODO elaborate on "line management vs project management", see page 30.
