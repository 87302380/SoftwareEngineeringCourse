# Software Engineering Course 2017
## Goals
- getting an overview about what modern software development is
- getting to know SOME current methods, tools and processes that are used in today's industry
- getting a feeling what it means to be a software craftsman (maybe even deciding if you want to become one or not)

---

## What this course is NOT about
- becoming an expert in a specific programming language, although there will be sessions that have a lot of code  
- deep-dive into theoretical scientific computer science, it's more about the everyday work as an engineer
- complete and correct and top-notch state-of-the-art in-depth study of modern software development - that doesn't exist

---

## Requirements
- understanding written and spoken english language 
- being able to read Java code (you don't need to be an expert, just know the basics)
- fundamentals of OOP

---

## I won't be around for long :)
- ... just this semester
- if you repeat this course, it will look very different!

---

## Material
- (nearly) everything is on [Github](https://github.com/stevenschwenke/SoftwareEngineeringCourse)

---

## Organizational information
(added when needed)

---

# Rules
- Be on time. That's 80% of success later on.
