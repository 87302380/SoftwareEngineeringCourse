# Digitization
![alt text](wayToDigitization.png)
- history: batch-systems -> online systems -> Client-Server -> Web-Systems -> mobile applications
- however: experiences and knowledge not sufficient for future => situation nothing new, nothing special - IT has to learn like everything else
- no global definition
- Uwe Friedrichsen: "Digitization means that IT is an integral part of business products and services."
![alt text](itIsBusiness.png)
- = "IT is business and business is IT"

## new expectations enforce new solutions
### Expectations
![alt text](expectations.png)
- User Experience
    - in-house applications have to be sexy, too!
    - applications visible to the "outside world" of course too!
- Performance
    - often expected: less than a second!
    - customer doesn't care about backend workload
- Multi-Device
    - mobile first = expectation
    - future: Smart TV, Connected Car, SmartWatches
- Availability
    - zero downtime
- Scalability
    - technically not important to the user
    - however: performance expectations lead to scalability
- Security
    - distributed systems != "just this one server"
-  Uncertainty
    - because of rise of IT and IT-services, customers expectations not certain
    - possible that long-planned, long-developed, expensive solutions neglected by customers => one solution: Agility.  

### Solutions
![alt text](solutions.png)
- Short Iterations
    - Agility
    - fast feedback
    - trial balloon
- Metrics
    - gather feedback
    - not just from users directly, but also using feedback systems (usage of features etc.)
- A-B-Tests
    - compare two solutions with each other
- Rollout Strategies
    - blue-green-deployment not flexible enough
    - [Canary Releases](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html) (rolling out new features to some users, only after testing to all users) to chosen, "friendly" key users

### Conclusion
![alt text](noSilverBullet.png)
- no silver bullet
- simply doing what has been done before will not solve these problems
- completely new concepts, architectures and approaches needed
- good news: most of the technology already exists, but has to be used in conjunction with each other

## Most important factor: speed
![alt text](speed.png)
- no more customer loyalty, user experience most important
- case study: Kodak
    - founded 1892
    - 1991 DC-100 first digital camera, 25.000 DM way to expensive
    - digital photography = future
    - despite first digital camera: loss of money, insolvent
- case study: Nokia
    - 1998 - 2011 worlds biggest manufacturer of mobile phones
    - 2007 Iphone
    - 2014 bought by Microsoft
- conclusion: Speed matters most!
- quickly available product beats perfect, late product
- case study: German automotive industry 2017
    - Volkswagen: "2030 every car in e-version"; Matthias Müller, Volkswagen: "Tesla = master of announcements" ("Ankündigungsweltmeister"), destroys money and fires employees
    - Tesla: 3 different models, more sells of Model S than Daimler's class S, more range, autonomous driving
    - experience, gathered data, internal infrastructure, customer feedback: some say "outperformed" 
- different culture needed - that's why labs and startups are founded by big companies: no sluggish processes, new young employees, freedom
- cross-functional teams important to deliver fast
- soft skills absolutely needed by every developer!

## IT = core of every company
![alt text](itCoreCompany.png)
- requirement: IT as consultant for core business (generating ideas, developing infrastructure and corporate architectures)
- structure of companies have to change to move IT into every aspect of the business
- examples for companies without real product, just IT:
    - Uber
    - Airbnb
- new: accessibility to IT: what once was only available to huge companies can now be used cheaply (Amazon Web Services for example)
- offerings have to be individually customisable, available in real-time, networked and integrated (compare Otto / Quelle vs Amazon)  
- software updates = new functionality, even without hardware change (Tesla)

## Rapid Prototyping & MVP
![alt text](MVP_v2.jpg)
(image by [Fred Voorhorst](http://www.expressiveproductdesign.com/minimal-viable-product-mvp/))
- new strategy: probe -> sense -> respond
- one example for this new strategy: Prototyping = develop test version of a product to gain insight, not to deliver finished product
- reduce complexity of product to absolute minimum
- create test version FAST
- MVP
    = minimal viable product 
    = drastically reduced versions of final product, but usable (Tesla Roadster, first IPhone)
    - Scrum and other agile methods build a Minimum Viable Product:
    - "that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort"
- important to have fast and direct feedback from actual customers (feedback-loop)
- learning fast = only way to win
- good rapid prototyping teams
    - are stable (to avoid storming-phase)
    - have great tools (to be as fast as possible)
    - are autonomous (don't wait for input of other teams or persons, have control over tools and processes)
    - lean processes
