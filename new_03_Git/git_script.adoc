== Introduction
* Goal of this chapter: just a brief overview about the most important aspects
* Why version control?
** understanding of history
** backup
** enabler for better development processes such as code reviews and feature development
* Git most recent and widely-used system, often successor of SVN

== Commits
* commit = set of changes
* can contain changes in multiple files
* consists of
** set of changes
** commit message = header + body
** hash
** hash of parent
* because every commit knows its parent: tree structure = commit graph

== Branches
* one commit only one parent, but possible that multiple commits having the same parent = branching
* enable parallel development
* important: common understanding how to branch
* multiple branching systems, for example http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[GitFlow]

== Merging
* = reuniting two branches
* for example when closing feature-, bugfix- or release-branches
* merge conflict = change in the same place, no automatic merging possible
* great support in tools like IntelliJ IDEA

== Live-Demo
. new feature-branch
. multiple small commits
. squash
. some more changes
. edit last commit message
. finish feature branch
. create release branch
. change version number
. finish release branch

== Advanced Features of Git
* editable commit graph, even after push (force push)
* amend
* Squashing
* Cherry-Picking
* Fast-Forward-Merges
* Rebasing
* Stash / Shelf
* .gitignore

== Tooling
* CLI, such as http://gitforwindows.org[GitBash for Windows]
* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA]
* https://www.gitkraken.com/[GitKraken]
* https://github.com/[Github]
* https://about.gitlab.com[GitLab]
