# Refactoring
## Definition
1. What is "refactoring"? 

## Principles in Refactoring
1. State and describe 3 of the 5 principles in Refactoring.

## Code smells as a source for refactoring
1. State and describe 8 of the 16 code smells.
2. Make a list of as many different code smells in the ugly trivia game as you can find.
3. Propose a refactoring for each code smell and describe its implementation.

## Small Refactorings
1. State 2 reasons for the refactoring "extract method".
2. When applying the refactoring "inline method", what important circumstance has to be checked before refactoring?
3. Write a short (!) code snippet or pseudo code snippet to illustrate 
    1. when to use "introduce explaining variable" and 
    2. when not to.
    (Hint: You have to write two short code snippets)
4. What is the refactoring "Remove assignments to parameters"? Why is it a good idea to do that?
5. Under which circumstances should "extract class" be applied?
6. What does "Replace data value with object" do? Why is it a good idea to do so?
7. There are refactorings "Change unidirectional association to bidirectional" and "Change bidirectional association with unidirectional". What is a unidirectional, what a bidirectional association?  
8. What does "Separate Query from modifier" do? Why is it a good idea to do so?
