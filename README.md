# SoftwareEngineeringCourse

## Meta: About the workshop
This is a Software Engineering course for students of computer science, level beginners to intermediate (3rd semester). 


### Current status
I plan to use the material provided in this repository for the software engineering course summer term 2018 at advanced technical college Ostfalia in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. I expect this repository to gain more and more content right until the start of the course in march 2018.

## Content
Will be upgraded continuously, see chapters.

States: planed -> content-gathering -> develop exercises and test questions -> rework to talk -> ready
