# SoftwareEngineeringCourse

## Meta: About the workshop
This is a Software Engineering course for students of computer science, level beginners to intermediate (3rd semester). 

### Requirements
- understanding written and spoken english language 
- being able to read Java code (you don't need to be an expert, just know the basics)

### Goals
- getting an overview about what modern software development is
- getting to know current methods, tools and processes that are used in today's industry
- getting a feeling what it means to be a software craftsman (maybe even deciding if you want to become one or not)

### What this course is NOT about
- becoming an expert in a specific programming language, although there will be sessions that have a lot of code  
- deep-dive into theoretical scientific computer science, it's more about the everyday work as an engineer 

### Current status
I plan to use the material provided in this repository for the software engineering course summer term 2018 at advanced technical college Ostfalia in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. I expect this repository to gain more and more content right until the start of the course in march 2018.
